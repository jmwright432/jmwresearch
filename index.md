# Jamie Michelle Wright

## A Brief Intro

My name is Jamie Wright and I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Houston. I specialize in American Politics with a focus on political behavior, political communication, and public opinion. My more specific interests are in the way that media, be that news or entertainment, impact political behaviors and attitudes of citizens in the United States, especially that of political trust, cynicism, and participation. I'm interested in the intersection of how the public engages with the media that surrounds us daily--be that through television, news, social media, or even now podcasts. These aspects of life are pervasive and their potential impacts on public opinion and political behavior are of enormous importance especially as the younger generations (aged 18-29) become larger and more engaged.
